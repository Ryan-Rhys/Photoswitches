Photoswitches

Proposal to generate an algorithm to relate photoswitching properties of azoheteroarenes to chemical and physical paramteres of individual switches.

Possible data descriptors/labels:
Torsional angle of E and Z isomers
Wiberg Index (bond length of azo)
Dipole moment
pi-pi* and n-pi* transitions as obtained from absorption spectra maxima
Reductive electrode potentials (not all azos have potentials reported)
Photostationary states, thermal half life of Z isomer

Machine Learning property prediction on azophotoswitches.
